Analytic Objective:
1. Is there a correlation between the fetal health and the fetal heart rate baseline, fetal movement and acceleration per second?
2. What are the indications on expectant mother's condition to detect fetal health?
3. What are the aspects that will influnce fetal health?
4. How does the fetal movement and uterine contraction affect the fetal health?
5. What are the effect of uterine contraction to the fetal heart rate?

USER STORY (10-20)
-----------------------
Role
Want to have
So that (business value)
- specific, measurable


DOCTOR
1. As a doctor , i would like to see the graph of relationship between fetal movement to fetal heart rate, so that i'll able to show the graph to the mother.
2. As a doctor using the healthcare data analytic application, i want to input the Cardiotocography result and show me fetal health status so that i can inform expectant mother the fetal development and quick detection on any issues with the fetus.
3. As a doctors in healthcare, we want to have an accurate report of mother and fetal development, so that we can reduce the risk of wrong diagnosis.
4. Aa a doctor, i would like to view the data in certain period of time only so that i can have a better diagnosis of fetal health.
5. As a doctor, i want the application to help the pregnant mother by give advice according the data from the app so that her pregnancy and birth will be as safe as possible

EXPECTANT MOTHER 
1. As an expectant mother using the healthcare application, I want to know what are the factors that indicates the fetal health so that i can monitor and visit the doctor soonest possible if any issues occur.
2. As a pregnant mother, i need to used the application that can access pregnancy health and fetal development information.
3. As a pregnant mother, I would like to know my uterine measurement is indicate normal, suspect or pathological fetal health using graph visualization.
4. As a pregnant mother without medical knowledge, I want the results to be readable and understandable so that I can tell the other people what I read.
5. As a user of the healthcare data analytic application system, I want to be able see the graph of the analysis so that I can visualize better of the data.
6. As a user, i would like a one click button option to get the data, so i can save my time.
7. As a user, I want a simple and user-friendly interface with navigation tabs so that I can access the application easier and understand the data more thoroughly based on the analysis made.
8. As a user, i would like this app to give me health suggestion if my data shows others than normal fetus health.
